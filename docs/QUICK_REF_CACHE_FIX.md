# Quick Reference: Context Cache & Formatting Fix

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. **Response Spacing** ✅
- Responses now have proper paragraph breaks
- Lists are properly formatted with spacing
- Text is more readable and not compressed

### 2. **Context Cache System** ✅
- Tracks which chunks were retrieved for which question
- Automatically clears when asking unrelated questions
- Prevents model confusion between different topics

## Key Features

### Automatic Cache Management
```python
# Cache is automatically managed in ask_question()
# Clears when:
# - Keyword overlap < 30%
# - More than 5 minutes passed
# - clear_conversation_history() called
```

### Format Instructions in Prompts
All prompts now include:
```
FORMATTING RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Use proper line breaks between paragraphs (add blank lines)
- For lists, use bullet points with proper spacing
- Add spacing after sentences for readability
- Structure your response with clear paragraphs
- Don't make the text too compact - add breathing room
```

## New Methods

### `_update_context_cache(query, chunks)`
Updates cache with newly retrieved chunks

### `_clear_context_cache()`
Resets the entire cache

### `_is_query_related_to_cached_context(query)`
Returns True if query is related to previous context (30% keyword overlap)

### `_get_context_cache_prompt_addition()`
Generates prompt clarification about context boundaries

## Cache Structure

```python
retrieved_context_cache = {
    'current_query': "What's the tuition?",
    'current_chunks': [
        {
            'content': 'Section 4.1 content...',
            'section': '4.1',
            'category': 'Financial'
        }
    ],
    'previous_query': "What's the grading scale?",
    'previous_chunks': [...],
    'timestamp': datetime.now()
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\test_context_cache.py
```

Tests:
1. ✅ Unrelated questions clear cache
2. ✅ Related questions keep cache
3. ✅ Cache expires after 5 minutes
4. ✅ clear_conversation_history() clears cache
5. ✅ Responses have proper formatting

## Example Usage

```python
from models.enhanced_rag_system import EnhancedRAGSystem

rag = EnhancedRAGSystem("data/student-handbook-structured.csv")

# Ask question - cache automatically managed
result1 = rag.ask_question("What's the tuition fee?")
# Cache now stores financial section chunks

# Unrelated question - cache automatically clears
result2 = rag.ask_question("What's the grading scale?")
# Cache now stores grading section chunks (previous cleared)

# Related follow-up - cache persists
result3 = rag.ask_question("What about payment deadlines?")
# Cache still has financial context
```

## Verification

Check if fix is working:
1. Ask about tuition
2. Immediately ask about grading
3. Verify response doesn't mention tuition info in grading answer
4. Check response has proper spacing (not a wall of text)

## Impact

**Before:**
- Responses were compact, hard to read
- Model could confuse context from previous questions
- No separation between different topic retrievals

**After:**
- Responses properly formatted with spacing
- Clear context boundaries between questions
- Automatic cache management prevents confusion
- Better accuracy and readability

## Configuration

Cache timeout (default 5 minutes):
```python
# In _is_query_related_to_cached_context()
if elapsed > 300:  # 5 minutes in seconds
    return False
```

Keyword overlap threshold (default 30%):
```python
# In _is_query_related_to_cached_context()
return overlap_ratio > 0.3  # 30% threshold
```

## Troubleshooting

**Cache not clearing?**
- Check keyword overlap calculation
- Verify timestamp is being set
- Ensure _clear_context_cache() is being called

**Formatting not working?**
- Verify FORMATTING RULES in prompt
- Check LLM temperature settings
- Model may need explicit \n\n in responses

**Context still confusing?**
- Lower overlap threshold from 0.3 to 0.2
- Reduce cache timeout from 300s to 180s
- Check logs for cache operations
