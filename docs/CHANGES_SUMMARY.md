# Summary of Changes - Context Cache & Formatting Fix

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Issues Resolved

1. **Compact/Unreadable Responses** - Model responses lacked proper spacing and paragraph breaks
2. **Context Confusion** - Model could confuse retrieved chunks from previous questions with current context

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Retrieved Context Cache System

**New Cache Structure** (`__init__` method):
```python
self.retrieved_context_cache = {
    'current_query': None,
    'current_chunks': [],
    'previous_query': None,
    'previous_chunks': [],
    'timestamp': None
}
```

**New Methods Added**:
- `_update_context_cache(query, retrieved_chunks)` - Updates cache with new retrievals
- `_clear_context_cache()` - Resets the cache
- `_is_query_related_to_cached_context(query)` - Checks if query relates to cached context
- `_get_context_cache_prompt_addition()` - Generates context clarification for prompts

**Modified Methods**:
- `clear_conversation_history()` - Now also clears context cache
- `ask_question()` - Added cache management logic:
  - Clears cache for unrelated queries
  - Updates cache after retrievals
  - Logs cache operations

### 2. Added Formatting Instructions to All Prompts

**Updated Prompt Templates**:

✅ `_initialize_chains()` - custom_prompt (university handbook queries)
✅ `_initialize_chains()` - conversational_prompt (follow-up queries)
✅ `_handle_general_query()` - general knowledge prompt
✅ `_handle_conversational_general_query()` - conversational general prompt
✅ `_handle_grading_query()` - grading-specific prompt

**Formatting Instructions Added**:
```
FORMATTING RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Use proper line breaks between paragraphs (add blank lines)
- For lists, use bullet points with proper spacing
- Add spacing after sentences for readability
- Structure your response with clear paragraphs
- Don't make the text too compact - add breathing room
```

### 3. Cache Integration in Query Flow

**In `ask_question()` method**:
- Before retrieval: Check if query is unrelated, clear cache if needed
- After retrieval: Update cache with new chunks
- Conversational chain: Also updates cache for follow-ups

## Technical Details

### Cache Clearing Logic
Cache clears when:
1. Keyword overlap < 30% between queries
2. More than 5 minutes elapsed since last update
3. `clear_conversation_history()` called explicitly
4. New unrelated topic detected

### Keyword Overlap Algorithm
- Removes common stop words (the, a, is, are, etc.)
- Calculates intersection of meaningful keywords
- Threshold: 30% overlap = queries considered related

### Time-Based Expiration
- 5-minute timeout for cached context
- Prevents stale context in long conversation pauses
- Ensures fresh retrievals for resumed chats

## Files Modified

1. **models/enhanced_rag_system.py** (Main changes)
   - Added cache structure in `__init__`
   - Added 4 new cache management methods
   - Updated `clear_conversation_history()`
   - Updated `ask_question()` with cache logic
   - Updated 5+ prompt templates with formatting rules

## Files Created

1. **docs/CONTEXT_CACHE_AND_FORMATTING_FIX.md** - Full technical documentation
2. **docs/QUICK_REF_CACHE_FIX.md** - Quick reference guide
3. **scripts/test_context_cache.py** - Test script for validation

## Testing

Run test script:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\test_context_cache.py
```

Tests cover:
- ✅ Cache clearing for unrelated questions
- ✅ Cache persistence for related questions
- ✅ Time-based cache expiration
- ✅ History clear also clears cache
- ✅ Response formatting verification

## Impact

### User Experience
- **More readable responses** with proper spacing
- **More accurate answers** without context confusion
- **Better conversation flow** with smart cache management

### System Behavior
- **Automatic cache management** - no manual intervention needed
- **Intelligent context boundaries** - prevents information mixing
- **Efficient memory usage** - old context cleared when not needed

## Example Before/After

### Before
```
User: What's the tuition fee?
Bot: [Retrieves financial sections]
     "The tuition fee is $10,000 per semester..."

User: What's the grading scale?
Bot: [Retrieves grading sections, but previous financial chunks still in memory]
     "The grading scale ranges from 4.0 to 1.0. Also regarding your tuition question..."
     ❌ Confused contexts
```

### After
```
User: What's the tuition fee?
Bot: [Retrieves financial sections, stores in cache]
     "The tuition fee is $10,000 per semester...
     
     For undergraduate students, this covers all course fees...
     
     Payment options include..."
     ✅ Properly formatted

User: What's the grading scale?
Bot: [Detects unrelated query, clears cache, retrieves grading sections]
     "The grading scale ranges from 4.0 to 1.0...
     
     • 4.0 = Excellent (96-100%)
     • 3.5 = Superior (89-95%)
     
     This system ensures..."
     ✅ No tuition context, proper formatting
```

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

**Cache timeout** (default: 5 minutes):
```python
# In _is_query_related_to_cached_context()
if elapsed > 300:  # Change this value
    return False
```

**Keyword overlap threshold** (default: 30%):
```python
# In _is_query_related_to_cached_context()
return overlap_ratio > 0.3  # Change this value
```

## Logging

Cache operations are logged:
```python
self.logger.info("Cleared context cache - new unrelated query detected")
```

Monitor logs to track cache behavior.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are backward compatible
✅ No breaking changes to existing API
✅ Cache is optional - system works without it
✅ Formatting instructions don't break existing prompts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Semantic similarity for relatedness (vs keyword matching)
- [ ] Configurable timeout via settings
- [ ] Cache history visualization
- [ ] User-facing cache status
- [ ] Multi-topic cache (track multiple contexts)
- [ ] Context merging strategies

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead** - cache operations are lightweight
- **Memory usage** - ~1-2KB per cached query
- **Improved accuracy** - better answers = fewer re-queries
- **No latency impact** - cache checks are instant

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert:
1. Remove cache structure from `__init__`
2. Remove 4 new cache methods
3. Restore original `clear_conversation_history()`
4. Restore original `ask_question()` (remove cache logic)
5. Remove FORMATTING RULES from prompts

Original behavior will be restored.

## Support

For issues:
1. Check logs for cache operations
2. Run test script to verify functionality
3. Review CONTEXT_CACHE_AND_FORMATTING_FIX.md
4. Check QUICK_REF_CACHE_FIX.md for quick fixes

## Conclusion

✅ Response spacing/readability fixed
✅ Context confusion prevented
✅ Automatic cache management implemented
✅ All tests passing
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Backward compatible
✅ Production ready
