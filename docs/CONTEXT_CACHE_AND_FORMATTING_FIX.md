# Context Cache and Response Formatting Fix

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Issue**: Model responses were compact/unreadable, and model could confuse retrieved chunks from previous questions with current context

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Response Spacing Issues
**Problem**: Model-generated responses lacked proper line breaks and paragraph spacing, making them difficult to read - text appeared compressed and wall-like.

**Solution**: Added explicit **FORMATTING RULES** to all prompt templates instructing the model to:
- Use proper line breaks between paragraphs (add blank lines)
- Use bullet points with proper spacing for lists
- Add spacing after sentences for readability
- Structure responses with clear paragraphs
- Avoid making text too compact - add breathing room

**Files Modified**:
- `models/enhanced_rag_system.py` - Updated all prompt templates:
  - `_initialize_chains()` - custom_prompt (university queries)
  - `_initialize_chains()` - conversational_prompt (follow-up queries)
  - `_handle_general_query()` - general_prompt
  - `_handle_conversational_general_query()` - conversational_prompt  
  - `_handle_grading_query()` - grading_prompt
  - `_handle_financial_query()` - financial prompt

### 2. Retrieved Context Confusion
**Problem**: When asking multiple unrelated questions, the model could confuse which handbook chunks were retrieved for which question. This led to incorrect answers mixing information from previous queries.

**Solution**: Implemented a **Retrieved Context Cache System** that:
- Tracks current and previous retrieved chunks
- Associates chunks with their specific query
- Automatically clears cache when detecting unrelated questions
- Provides context clarity in prompts

## New Features

### Context Cache System

#### Cache Structure
```python
self.retrieved_context_cache = {
    'current_query': None,        # Current question
    'current_chunks': [],         # Chunks retrieved for current question
    'previous_query': None,       # Previous question
    'previous_chunks': [],        # Previous chunks
    'timestamp': None             # When cache was last updated
}
```

#### New Methods

**`_update_context_cache(query, retrieved_chunks)`**
- Updates cache with newly retrieved chunks
- Moves current to previous
- Stores chunk metadata (content preview, section, category)

**`_clear_context_cache()`**
- Resets entire cache
- Called when starting new conversation
- Prevents stale context leakage

**`_is_query_related_to_cached_context(query)`**
- Determines if new query is related to previous context
- Uses keyword overlap analysis (30% threshold)
- Considers time elapsed (5-minute timeout)
- Returns boolean for relevance

**`_get_context_cache_prompt_addition()`**
- Generates prompt addition to clarify context boundaries
- Tells model which sections/categories the context is from
- Prevents confusion between current and previous retrievals

### Updated `clear_conversation_history()` Method
Now also clears retrieved context cache, ensuring complete memory reset.

### Updated `ask_question()` Method
- Checks if new query is unrelated to cached context
- Automatically clears cache for unrelated questions
- Updates cache after each retrieval
- Logs cache clearing for debugging

## Usage Impact

### For Users
- **Better readability**: Responses now have proper spacing and structure
- **More accurate answers**: Model won't confuse context from different questions
- **Natural conversation flow**: Cache maintains relevance while preventing confusion

### For Developers
```python
# Cache is managed automatically, but can be manually controlled:

# Clear cache manually
rag_system._clear_context_cache()

# Check if query is related to cached context
is_related = rag_system._is_query_related_to_cached_context("What about tuition?")

# Cache is automatically updated on each retrieval in ask_question()
```

## Technical Details

### Cache Clearing Logic
Cache is cleared when:
1. Query is detected as unrelated (< 30% keyword overlap)
2. More than 5 minutes have elapsed since last update
3. `clear_conversation_history()` is explicitly called
4. System detects a new conversation topic

### Keyword Overlap Algorithm
```python
# Removes common words (the, a, an, is, are, etc.)
# Calculates overlap ratio between query keywords
# Threshold: 30% overlap = considered related
```

### Time-Based Expiration
- Cache expires after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Prevents stale context in long pauses
- Ensures fresh context for resumed conversations

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unrelated Questions
```
User: "What's the tuition fee?"
Bot: [Retrieves Section 4.1 financial data, stores in cache]

User: "What's the grading scale?"
Bot: [Detects < 30% keyword overlap with "tuition"]
     [Clears cache - prevents mixing financial and grading context]
     [Retrieves Section 3.2 grading data, stores new cache]
```

### Scenario 2: Related Follow-up
```
User: "What's the tuition fee?"
Bot: [Retrieves Section 4.1, stores in cache]

User: "What about payment options?"
Bot: [Detects 40% keyword overlap with "tuition"]
     [Keeps cache - questions are related]
     [May reference previous financial context]
```

### Scenario 3: Time Expiration
```
User: "What's the tuition fee?"
Bot: [Retrieves Section 4.1, timestamp: 2:00 PM]

[6 minutes pass]

User: "And the payment deadline?"
Bot: [Cache expired (> 5 minutes)]
     [Clears cache automatically]
     [Fresh retrieval for deadline information]
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**
   - Responses are properly formatted with spacing
   - Lists and bullet points are clearly structured
   - Text is easier to scan and understand

2. **Context Accuracy**
   - Model knows exactly which chunks apply to current question
   - No confusion between different topic areas
   - Cleaner separation of conversation topics

3. **Better User Experience**
   - More natural conversation flow
   - Accurate answers without cross-contamination
   - Transparent context management

4. **Debugging Capabilities**
   - Cache operations are logged
   - Can inspect what's stored in cache
   - Clear visibility into context management

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following scenarios:
1. Ask about tuition, then immediately ask about grading (cache should clear)
2. Ask about tuition, then payment options (cache should persist)
3. Wait 6 minutes between questions (cache should expire)
4. Check response formatting for proper spacing and structure
5. Verify no context leakage between unrelated topics

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Semantic similarity for relatedness (instead of just keyword overlap)
- Configurable cache timeout duration
- User-visible cache status indicator
- Cache history for debugging
- Advanced context merging strategies
